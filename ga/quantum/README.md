This is an in-progress attempt to create a circuite visualizer where entanglement is visualized. Should not be considered stable!

The codebase significantly involves both matrix algebra and the lesser-known "Clifford" algebra, see 31.js.

## Current controls

-Click the bloch spheres at the start to change the initial state
-To add gates, hover your mouse over the wire, anywhere, and press A, B, or C
