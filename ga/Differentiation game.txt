--------------------FIELDS
Do it in raw webgl. Bootstrap your shaders!
Maybe wait until they've nailed join lines
This is CALCULUS. Don't expect to get it right the first time, just try things out

Different spaces:
    "points on the surface of the sphere" = sphere at infinity?
    1D scalar space. A bar chart, when comparing
    1D circle = directions in 2D? = angles?
    mass space, how heavy some things are
    Binary space, {1,-1}. A button...
    If you've got a 1D/2D simulation
        The space of that 2D simulation
    The surface in which you're doing the thing
    "Vector space" where you can add things, distinct from PGA-type spaces ("euclidean" spaces)
    RGB color space/hue, also alpha
    A closeup of "a point" in a domain space, = uv
    A 2D vector space within a 3D vector space requires a 2x3 matrix
        Try to just drag it into one and it'll automatically make that matrix and initialize it to a default
    "Rasterized space", a 2D space such that you ascribe colors to each place in it
        That's a window in which you are *not* comparing things

Actions
    Press a button and see a space where all the various variables of that type superimposed


Your calculus thing is just one example of that
PGA/CGA gives you a nice set of visualizable geometric objects you can have and work with and program with
The spaces give you the way you work with them
Something YOU would use
Hook to unity transform

Array for light sources

unreal and unity don't compile shaders at runtime

--------------------DIFFERENTIATION
Low priority. Work on known-good ideas then "listen"

It is surely a good idea to do the "little jumps" by applying a translation instead of adding a scalar,
    because the space you're looking at may not be euclidean

e1, e123, e4, e423
x1,y1 outer x2,y2
x1*e1+y1*e4 gp x2*e23+y2*e14
x1*x2*e123  + x1*y2*e4  +  y1*x2*e423 +  y1*y2*e1

x1*e1+y1*e4 gp x2*e3+y2*e2
x1*x2*e13  + x1*y2*e12  +  y1*x2*e43 +  y1*y24

x1*e1+y1*e3 gp x2*e2+y2*e3
x1*x2*e12  + x1*y2*e13  +  y1*x2*e23 +  y1*y2

If everything is differentiable WRT inputs you can figure out where things should be given a certain specified output
	You can freeze every other object and see how this one reacts
		Which is like taking a 2D slice of 3D, then 1D slice of 2D, and seeing

Maybe pinch to zoom is a good interface to get to your differentials?

if you can get the kids to determine a differential at a point in time, that's all you need to make things with behaviour

Adding up a series of line segment lengths - that is much more like actual fucking integration

You want a generalization of frenet serret
	differentiation in 1D, whatever who cares, probably crap to base everything on that
	Generalize to nD...
	That probably means... a tangent vector...
	Probably you're just going to do derivatives with tangent lines

Do not sweat curves. The only import differential is over time

Are you about to just reinvent 3D animation?
To be fair you're trying to make it so you can do stuff like that but in a way that can be programmed

Different values are viewed differently in different contexts. 
	And to make the most of visual intuition they need to be seen differently in the different contexts
	Their units give you info about that. 




The transfinite induction wheel might be a great interface for doing calculus
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfinite_induction

Choose your point on the curve and perform a mobius transformation
such that that point is blown up and everything else about the curve gets sent to infinity
What is that as an MT?

make the curve MASSIVE, we're zoomed in on a point on it
Maybe the curve is now out at infinity, smooshed onto that sphere?

Multiplication and division are best visualised on the projective line. Erm, why?



BRDF EE (because want to get started with calculus)
	Mention the 4 vs pi thing
	Do it for one color channel, so looking black and white, and combine them because apparently that's ok
	Microfacets, averaging
	Deduce from geometric optics?
	Ask Chris
	It's more statistical than calculus-like



Need clever stuff about hiding and showing again
    Maybe select what objects your thing is based on, everything else disappears. Maybe they're not in your hands, they're just there

The "curve -> stack of infinity copies of the manifold getting bigger (and inverted, past 0) in both directions" idea of a metric is sticking


You're drawing paths.
These paths are in direction space.
A point traces out where it'll go in actual space
But, that's only 2D. The ball actually has to explore in 3D
So you have to do two paths, one for a point at the top, one at the bottom
They both trace out what they do. They are joined by a line, and you have to make the line avoid obstacles and hit treasures
It's a tube/rail shooter

How do you know what moment in time maps to the thing?
    So it is in 3D. While your finger is down, time moves forwards
    You can "backtrack" though, i.e. move the slice down
    You have a limited amount of "fuel", i.e. the integral can't go beyond a certain value
    Maybe you're trying to minimize that integral, the action

There are obstacles and goodies in the velocity space too?

Colored possibilities, by viridis. All in the same space. When they're together, that's white. Many worlds flappy bird
You have to deal with all the possibilities





Defining a motor (so just a hand movement), even defining a curve, maps all of 3-space, quite powerful
Differentiate that, and you have, instantaneously, a velocity field everywhere
    In 3D looks like a cylinder with all the arrows going around it, potentially one infinitely far away
And a force field? 
Is it a velocity? Don't you have second derivative too?

The purpose of this is to try to make a single gesture control a vector field? Or a bunch of behaviour?
A general rigid-body path can be visualized with a ruled surface. That's nice
Something else you might want is

Doing it with gaze is probably right.
    Hold the "I want to grab what I'm looking at" button and look from thing to thing; what you look at will appear in your hand
    Once you definitely have what you want in your hand, let go of the button and now it's stuck there

consider (t,t^2) vs (2t,(2t)^2). They'll look the same
	Same with (-t,t^2).
	(1,2t) vs (2,4t). These are the same at the same point though. Implicit functions are not unique
	That's homogeneity at work
	vector tangent to f: f'(t) = (1,2x)

Calculus / dual numbers viz
    it's just nice if a function returns, not only its value at a point, but also the direction you're going in in the codomain
    Possibly integration is an example of something with multiple inputs, i.e. currying parts of it might not help?
    Volume rendering is a good viz of integral
    The "right" way to visualize a derivative wrt one variable (implicit or explicit) is
        the height of the right angled triangle of base 1 whose hypotenuse is tangent to that
    "Behaviour" is about responses to changes. Changes happen over time. To study changes over time you need calculus
    Because you can do slicing, should be able to think of all derivatives as spatial derivatives instead of time
    Don't forget strogatz style
        Particle on the line, the curve above it tells it whether to go left or right. f:R->R is a vector field too
        Er, so in 2D?
    To do Inventing On Principle Style omniscient select-the-time debugging for non-trivial games:
        Consider the fact that they have a state s and an update function u
        smoothstep is your differentiable sigmoid
        If the update function depends on the current state you have a differential equation
            otherwise(?) just get its antiderivative and you'll
            Maybe all the current-state-dependent advancements can be socially enforced dynamicland/sport style. Examples of these:
                "last state was losing condition, so you have a game over screen"
                "Restart" button
                win, loss are specific binaries
        Ideally we can immediately get s given time since initialization and functions over time of what the controller input values were
        This is asking a lot from game developers... how much do you get from it?
            Can get super helpful omniscient debugger if everything is differentiable
            Maybe describe a bug situation then automatically solve the equation to see if it ever happens
            Gamedevs do want to make nice wobbly physics-y stuff, they should commit to it
        Maybe this is the difference between physics and games, you do get nice non-differential equations sometimes
        Ordinary: you have your state/frame s, and your update function u, next state/frame is u(s). S is an array of multivectors
            u'(s) is your differential
            Gonna have to simulate many frames forward to get full visualization of a reasonable game
            We definitely do have u(s,frameDelta), all games do. Can differentiate
                Are there any nasty differential equations in there? Blow would say yes
    They should call integration "accumulation". "Differentiation" is probably fine
    It needs built in derivatives because it's a language for physics course
    Bret integration https://youtu.be/oUaOucZRlmE?t=1266
    The epsilon of integration is directly linked to the scale at which you are looking at the thing. dt = width of a pixel
    You draw a graph (left to right bottom to top say) by evaluating the function at the left side of a pixel, then at the right, then drawing pixels accordingly
    The derivative of the area function is the function on top of it. That's a 2D -> 1D thing. Can you think about nth derivatives in any other dimensional-kind of way?
    The more terms you have in a taylor series, the better your numerical approximation will be

Surely something very GA going on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_using_Euler%27s_formula
