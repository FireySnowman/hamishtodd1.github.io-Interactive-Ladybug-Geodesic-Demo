	Possibly better would be a table, "medium" against "subject matter"

	Imagine a disinterested person on their mobile
	Also imagine someone very interested in you
	They're going to this page to be entertained. If anyone's ever going to read those interviews

	All your works are rectangles
		Ones in same category are connected to a single special node that isn't a work?
		And all works repel each other
		How to draw the sections?
			Metaballs, radius = half spring length
			But you don't want them to get anywhere near

	You might like some subregions to have a subheading and extra stuff

	Nice how it could adjust to any screen size

	Have things horizontally aligned

	People who have influenced me and connections between them

	Text needs to be not-pixellated and big enough to read, probably CSS
			
	Pixelshaders from webgl, but do rather want CSS -> youtube embed. Let them load later!

	Pinch to zoom?

	Click on a section
		It is now centered
		Click outside it, and we're back to master

	When you click on a work
		Its section is centered and it is centered in its section
		Its rectangle enlarges
		Corners connected by springs
		Potentially, it embeds
		Or at least you get an image preview

	Venns
