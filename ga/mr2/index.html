	TODO Bugs
		Fucking which way is z
		Bug with your mind: you want to reinvent calculus

	So you have your algebra, you have your visualizations
		And for one visualization, you can change is algebraic, er, significance. I.e. its type?
			Eg arrow left arrow up. Add the arrows.
				If they're PGA elements, you get the point inbetween.
				If LA elements, get the arrows concatenated
		And for one type / algebraic structure, you can change its visualization
			Eg crowd of people
				The visualization of the people
				The number of them that are infected
		Pong game states are an algebraic structure, with only maybe 3 dimensions

	Maybe you do want helmet / VR?
		Pros:
			Can see and touch the things in front of you
			Specify points on the globes in 3D
		Cons: Keyboard is useful for:
			changing the name of a globe
	Maybe... the lines of code create an animation, step through it using your cursor
		Or, you have certain lines where you display what's in each frame of the animation, then ctrl up and down to get between them
		If you know how the value was derived, you know what tweening animation to have? Professionalism is all just tweening
		Well you want to be able to make things gesturally, Bret style, right? Animations simulate that

	Needed to make the maps / geometric interpretation
		+, cos, sin, exp
		Whenever you see "sin lat", that's projection onto line
		Extract lat and lon
		Slice lat and lon
		Unwrapping lon
		Geometrically interpret the functions (stare at maps.js):
			Slicing system that allows you to see a sliced-open globe
				Just a different uvBuffer, gl.LINE
				You could draw on the globe and see results of that!
			A lot of it is about projection. Sending projection point to infinity

	General TODO
		Function syntax
		Planes

	Filming setup
		Semi transparent background to pad
		Nice camera
		Go from relevant line to relevant line. Sounds like you're cutting stuff out though

	Hey, could have "cartesian product" symbol, mathematicians would like you
		Or tensor product
		f x g = {(x,y) : there exists A,B s.t. f(A), g(B) }
		Or, ordinary javascript arrays
		But this isn't about arrays it's about functions

	General visual algebra
		New algebra for every video
		you have a way of defininig literals. Strings (bits really but strings do)
		you have functions defined on that algebra
		Sometimes you want different viz for different things. Real view, disc view, color view

	Fun GA things probably unnecessary to world map so avoid:
		pss
		dual, join

	After
		Videos about projective geometry
		Oi, "demonstrations" / footage. Classical mechanics. But better to wait for built in AR?
		Demo of features of this thing
		omicron reduction
		"A different way to visualize calculus" - there's a lot of fun to be had with weird algebras (SR, QC) before you get to this
		Draw curve, get curve as usable thing. Killer app!
		Convert to single visualization (for Brilliant)
		If you're serious about people making clothes, think about makeup tutorials
		transpile to glsl first and foremost. Whole game runs in every shader woo!
		Eventually: VR game with conformal transformations. To help build folks' intuition? No! Because they're fun!
