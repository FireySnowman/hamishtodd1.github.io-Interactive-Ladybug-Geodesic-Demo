   Notes
        Tokieda thing?
        Dual quaternions

        Meet and join
        Need concrete example of rotation and translation
        Will be good to see the line and the rotation quantity visualized in place
        Pappus? parabola->oval?
 
    Script
        Projective geometry is extremely widely used.
        Game engines like Unreal and Unity and practically everyone else has some amount of projective geometry,
            in particular with this thing called the "w" coordinate which I'll explain in this video.
            But many areas of maths, physics and engineering use it too, and they often get a better understanding of it than you see in the games industry
            With the exception of the Cry engine (video) That company knows their projective geometry very well

        These parallel lines are going to meet
   
        Actually you're using this concept any time you say the words "right", "left", "forwards" or "backwards"

        Obviously you have the visualizations in 1, 2, 3 dimensions

    Script for second video
        Dual, meet, join

    For sure the right way to project from 4-sphere is orthographic
        People are used to looking at half-spheres, it'll be like that
