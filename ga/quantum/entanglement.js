    Hadamard matrix should look like the map is flattened to gnomonic and doing a flip

    Think of it as... a nice spikey jewel, like a henry segerman thing
    Aaaaand it does have volumes, and when it's rested they're solid. But when you change it they fade in and out

    we want G such that G appears to be a reflection and G*swap = something you suspect is a rotation
    Problem is, it's probably a reflection that DOESN'T combine to become the X x I etc
    Though hmm, maybe hadamard is

    paulis x Id in 2-qubit = line reflections - Wanting this to work because got 6 similar things
        If you only have e1 and e2 and e3 is the SPHERE at infinity(!), that's it
        e123 is the center of the plane you're in
        e3 remains the sphere at infinity
        When you're thinking about one qubit, e1 acts as a hyperplane (line)
        but maybe e1 stays as a line (line reflection), e14?
        Anyway, to get from reflection to rotation you multiply by pss, e123, to get the point that Rx will rotate around
        Yes it works if e1 becomes e14 and pss is e1234 instead of e123
        Problem is this "stealing" thing, plus, e14 squares to -1, not 1

    Presentation style:
        Split screen
        Do have oculus tracker. Try doing it as if in a mirror. 

    If this was going to work, wouldn't it work in CGA? And wouldn't Chris have found it?
    "vectors are points" would have to be quite toxic
    
    Dodecahedral honeycomb
        So you're making trivectors with, what, the five-fold and threefold rotation of the dodecahedron?
        Aaaaaand then you have a translation as well?

    Metaphysics
        Is it that everything appears in experiment to be a rotation when actually some things are reflections?

    A problem might be that the CNOT is not a reflection in the unitary representation of pin
    In which case you're back to the previous square, because you don't know if unitary reps are 

    Take the quaternion pair. one is 1,e12,e23,e31 the other is that * I.

    How about showing ordinary logic? A classical CNOT

    People have this idea of "the controlled not gate", and it's a particular set of 0s and 1s
    But clearly you should be able to change some -1s and "i"s or whatever and it's essentially doing the same thing
    i.e. surround it with some paulis
    And really what's going on is this rotational relation you can show
    I mean if you have some crazy business affecting qubit A, and after all that you apply it to the untouched B, what happens?

    Separable = isoclinic?

    Visualizations
        The thing itself
        The gates. Even if you only have two qubit gates, nice for them to know notation / have something to keep track of what you've done
        Show ordinary hopf fibration obv. Quite interesting in pga view, set of lines
        Ordinary bloch sphere
        Ordinary 2D elliptic PGA sphere which you maniupulate by moving its projection around. Most informative thing you can have is probably latitude lines
        A measurement device that works across all of these?

    Script - "But what does quantum entanglement LOOK LIKE?"
        Quantum entanglement is, without exaggeration, one of the strangest things ever discovered.
        It's central to quantum physics so it's important if you want to understand why the periodic table has this shape, or how computer chips are made,
        But for me entanglement most intriguing because of its implications for philosophy, metaphysics, and epistemology. In a sense you can resolve the schrodinger's cat paradox
        In this video I want to give an intuitive sense for what entanglement is, which I'll do using this visualization of it

        The gnomonic projection is simply what you see if you're at the center of the globe (so maybe zoom in on the real viz?)
        We can do a sequence of moves on the surface of the globe by rotating around different points on it

        Need some cute portable thing that's only ever 00 or 11. A pair of teenage girls where one of them has said she liked/didn't like the movie
        We're going to make a single object that exists in two separate pieces, like a pair of semi-matching socks

        "When" "you" measure "your" qubit, you join the universe where your qubit was that result,
        and you know what universe that's going to be for your partner

        

        If we take an ordinary sphere and imagine an ant on its surface, 

    Coooool: the fact that the dof grows quadratically rather than exponentially

    "Partial trace" is one way of separating out states




    Volume-preserving transformations are nice for interpretability because you can always interpret the thing as a probability
    So maybe even ML shouldn't use matrices?

    The connection between circular exponential and scalar exponential might be illustrated by those large-gear-ratio things?

    Yes you can always find a change of basis such that it's a tensor product

    Maybe the series of qubits is like a long robot arm? each qubit a joint?
    Or like those gyroscopes where you control the gibals

    so it's still a complex 4-vector. It's just not a 4-vector that can be written as the tensor product of 2 2-vectors

    what's the inner product?
    cos(t) is defined by e(t) - e(-t), or maybe +

    Surely, surely as part of this you have a visualization of taking the squared norm of the probabilities
    Sphere to equilateral triangle

    No idea what controlled-not will look like as a rotation. It has to be something.

    Look, when you use any gate on the state, isn't the system now entangled with the machine because it knows you used that gate on it?

    Maybe a measurement is another thing that "splits" the state? You can summarize all the universes you aren't in...

    It's kinda like euler angles to have these damn complex numbers everywhere

    Two copies of the hue circle, one light one dark, connected by brightness variation

    "In 2D, if you give me some rotation around the origin and followed by movement in some direction...
        there is always some point I can find which, if rotated around that point, it gives you that full movement"
    That's true in 2D. In 3D...
    that's CLOSE to being true, but actually there is a way that you can fuck me over

    The 48-cell is interesting. Has 8-fold so long as you have the extra translation
    If you want to have a T-gate it's probably not one of the nice polytopes
    You want to rotate it around a line by 1/8 and have it look the same?
    Consider 16-cell, double the

    You want something such that all the edges form great circles
    Something such that

    Maybe if you're hiding alternate things?

    For the faces


    if it were 3D, an octahedron
    Each opposing point pair corresponds to a single point in plane


    Gonna have extracting the actual bits
    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monogamy_of_entanglement




    Is it actually true?
        Imagine an object superimposed on its rotation by 90 degrees. That is the unit complex number. No phase necessary because you haven't had to choose "where the unit is". It does somewhat become that way because you say "well, *I* am looking at it at this angle...

        Multiple dofs are probably tied up in "your choice of what the identity looks like"

        For each complex number, choose a screw axis, the phase gives the rotation around that axis and the magnitude gives the translation along it? HUUUUGE problem with magnitude is it has this bullshit about starting from 0 (from a "corner of the room". You're probably better off thinking about the real part and the imaginary part

        *****The real parts are constrained to a 3-sphere in 4D. The imaginary parts, well one of them doesn't exist. Sooooo, 3 imaginary parts = 3 euler angles ***** NO, 3 *PHASES*, YOU DO HAVE 4 IMAGINARY PARTS
        p1 = (Re(c1), Re(c2), Re(c3), Re(c4))
        p2 = (Im(c1), Im(c2), Im(c3), Im(c4))
        Both points in 4D. Magnitude constraint. Probably their magnitudes are like p1^2 + p2^2 = 1
        Maybe, Magnitude of p1 is angle1, magnitude of p2 is angle2? Buuuuut probably there's only one dof between them since they're on a circle, like they're sin and cos of some angle
        Leftover are 2 unit 4-vectors (unless one of them is zero!!!)
        Which correspond to points in your space
        Join those points, get a line, take the rotation by angle 1 and "translation" by angle 2 along that line?



        The effect of the magnitude constraint is going to have some split between impacting the real part and the imaginary part
        So, this whole shit will have some non-visualizable-as-a-motor part that you'll need to shift around to make it visualizable as a motor
        The hope is that in the case of unentangled that looks like translation or rotation, whereas if entangled, not so much





        In 4D, you have the 4 basis planes (of the 6!). Can distinguish eg
