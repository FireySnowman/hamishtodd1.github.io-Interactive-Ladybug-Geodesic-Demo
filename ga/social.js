    You're spending too much time around theoretical physicists for this
    The metric is euclidean, the units are meters

    They're carrying a pad around with them.
    The whole environment is the final dw
    Fully Bret-like interaction, not just typing

    Do they need the pad?
        Choose a visible thing. We could show all the other things that determine its appearance, including your debug visualizations
        Ideally it's order-unimportant (purely declarative), that would mean the answer is no

    Put faces on everything, people's brains are transformed into supercomputers when you recast maths in a social context

    Photo editing

    Philosophical-sounding
        It's all about constraints, give an interface for making constraints

    it would be nice to pick up a value that is a length and compare it to the thing you're looking at

    Trying to picture it
        So the kids are drawing clothes on themselves
        And giving those clothes behaviour, so the clothes respond to what their friends do
        Making little games including pong

    The kids could make games for each other. No need to download them, they just implement them themselves
    
    "You need to be able to make"
        pong
        a rope
        a bouncing ball
        a phong shader

        Maybe you can send one another stuff to be seen in the browser version but only make it in the paid version?
        So there's an object you can buy. You can buy several. You can buy them with nice skins. Maybe a bouncy ball. The app knows its position and orientation and that is all the input you need. Maybe not bouncy at all, you want it light. Want velctro, or a clip.

    Things you get as input from CV
        Pose / skeleton
        Position and quaternion of arbitrary objects

    Thinking about making clothes is good because they *can* be static, for a beginner

    Is there some kind of ink you could mark stuff with that only appears in infared?

    Kids could program particle effects that come from their dancing friends. Pose estimation is cracked right?
    Users want to program it to recognize gestures in a custom way, because dancing competitions
