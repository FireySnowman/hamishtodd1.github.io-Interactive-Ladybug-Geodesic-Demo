    It's all about constraints, give an interface for making constraints

    it would be nice to pick up a value that is a length and compare it to the thing you're looking at

    So the kids are drawing clothes on themselves
    And giving those clothes behaviour
    Making little games including pong


    The kids could make games for each other. No need to download them, they just implement them themselves
    Can you make pong with the system?

    If you have spot A that is a relevant vector and spot B that is a relevant vector, and you make the vector between them, it can hover there


    Maybe you can send one another stuff to be seen in the browser version but only make it in the paid version?
    So there's an object you can buy. You can buy several. You can buy them with nice skins. Maybe a bouncy ball. The app knows its position and orientation and that is all the input you need. Maybe not bouncy at all, you want it light. Want velctro, or a clip.

    Come from webcam? Use the tech people have

    Wanna make it so people have the ability to make shaders themselves. Their actions get "compiled" into "code" (haha it's electricity) that does something they like

    Thinking about making clothes is good because they can be static

    Envision a future where the kids of lots of programmers are using bivectors and they all say "what the hell?", And they learn and say OH MY GOD this is what QM is!

    AR https://jeromeetienne.github.io/AR.js/three.js/examples/basic.html
    Is there some kind of ink you could mark stuff with that only appears in infared?

    AR level editor for everyone

    So record yourself with a qr code, throw it in the air etc. Put it into AR.js and stick a cube on top of it. Can get position and quaternion right out!

    Kids could program particle effects that come from their dancing friends. Pose estimation is cracked right?

    Ask Vi about the controller juggling stuff

    The CV training I have in mind could be done by a master's student

    Sell little strip stickers that get recognized as vectors and scalars and bivectors and trivectors.

    There's some pwg in here
