/*
    Maybe, er, we can easily take the fourier transform of a mesh?
		Maybe taking the fourier transform of an image will let you extract what you want: positions of little red things, orientation+position of lines
	Would parametric/continuous approach be better for raytracing? If so someone would have thought of it
	Stack machine: default behaviour can be that whatever was on the above line is the first argument
		Might get rid of this "to delete or copy" question in abacus?
	Names are good for indexing the things you want to talk in a smaller space; A hash table
