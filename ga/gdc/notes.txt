    Make an interface
    Make some puppets!

Interface
    "Professional" version won't have the faces anyway
    const pile: just make things whenever and store them
    Drag the variable into a ring and you're referencing it


So could barrel ahead with this group idea. It's not obviously a BAD idea yet
It's just freaky to not know where it's going
I mean it IS nice to be able to work on what's on a hand
    you were thinking about that anyway with the CGA watch
    so if you're definitely doing that


First goal
    Might as well start with Cl(3), avoid infinities
        Puzzle 0, "you gotta match up the boxes"
            Nothing in the box, you just gotta put it there
            Give the goal box some eyeballs
                It and the workBox hold hands and look happy when they disappear
        Puzzle 1, "you gotta make the thing that's in the box":
            A plane, in the box (e1, but you don't know that)
            Just make the plane e1, it's probably a single button
        Puzzle 2, "confirming that":
            e2 and e3 superimposed
        Puzzle 3, "The midpoint monster":
            A Line in the box, it's e12
            Gotta stick e1 and e2 in a robot and bring in midpoint monster

        Puzzle X, "The time monster"
            Time monster is a scalar. It repeatedly counts to 4 or so (tweak it), a reasonable length for a loop

        Need to make something challenging without animation

        Puzzle N:
            There is a line in the center, e13
            There is another line, e12, going round and round the pole, occasionally touching its original
            You need to
                make e13 and e12, easy
                make a rotor monster by connecting the "time" monster to the pole and an exponential monster
                then connect the rotor monster to a sandwich monster and the plane you made

                Or, instead of time, do you do it by making a slight, constant change every frame?


The const box
    You always get e1, e2, e3
    It floats around, relative to you, always at your side (but not moving too fast)
    The boxes appear to be groups. So, a box might be a bad idea

So, you've brought in groups



Vlojure + GA
    This is a game and a puppet show program
    Needs to be a game first in order to be fun

Have a usable PGA subset
Maybe even a (2,1) subset
Read that paper PGA as subalgebra of CGA

First few levels should not use demons, so make those



Have the little demons

The Vlojure interface
    There is a cutoff, ones that are several scopes away just fade
    Maaaaybe that 3D tree effect
        Maybe it can be used to elegantly make big stuff small
    controls
        A
            Bring over a monster from your roster
        B

        index
        middle

        joystick
            Navigate and push and pop
        Can lean over with other hand and go to a spot
